# Sorting Algorithms Visualiser

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualiser! This project is designed to help you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to see how different algorithms work step-by-step.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed to control the visualization pace.
- Option to generate random arrays of different sizes.

## Known Bugs

- Comparison visualiser doesn't accurately work for Merge Sort and Selection Sort.

## Upcoming Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: A new feature to visualize the process of solving Sudoku puzzles.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: Visualize algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Maze Solver**: Implement and visualize maze solving algorithms using Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms.

## Usage

Visit [Sorting Algorithms Visualiser](https://algo-visualiser-zeta.vercel.app/) to use the application online.

## Installation
