# Sorting Algorithms Visualiser

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualiser! This project is designed to help you understand and visualize various sorting algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to see how different algorithms work step-by-step.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed to control the visualization pace.
- Option to generate random arrays of different sizes.

## Upcoming Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: A new feature to visualize the process of solving Sudoku puzzles.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: Visualize algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algo-visualiser.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd algo-visualiser
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You will see the interface where you can select different sorting algorithms and visualize their execution.
